Betaflight Configurator is a crossplatform configuration tool for the Betaflight flight control system.

It runs as an app within Google Chrome and allows you to configure the Betaflight software running on any [supported Betaflight target](https://github.com/betaflight/betaflight/tree/betaflight/src/main/target).

Various types of aircraft are supported by the tool and by Betaflight, e.g. quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters and fixed-wing aircraft.
