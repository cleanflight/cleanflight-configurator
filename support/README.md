# Build & Support Files

This directory is not to be included in the Chrome App release.

## Gulp Taks Runner

The `gulpfile.js` build script provides gulp tasks to validate the sourcecode (js, html, css) and to package the a Chrome App ZIP-File containing all necessary files for the publication in the Chrome Web Store.

## Running gulp

the default task will perform all validation steps and package the application. For Windows users it is recommended to use the Cygwin-Shell as the `.jshintrc` file will not be picked up correctly otherwise resulting in too strict validation and lots of false alarms.

### Prerequisites

* node.js (+npm)
* Cygwin bash/zsh shell (Windows users only)

### Installing / Running

Install all npm dev dependencies and optionally update your PATH (`setenv.sh`) environment variable if you do not plan on installing gulp globally.

The default Gulp task will validate js, css, html and package a release zip file `chrome_app_release.zip` placed in the support directory.

Example:

```
➜  npm install
➜  source setenv.sh
➜  gulp

[14:09:02] Using gulpfile ./gulpfile.js
[14:09:02] Starting 'validate_js'...

(...)
(...)
(...)

[14:09:05] 'validate_js' errored after 2.68 s
[14:09:05] Error in plugin 'gulp-jshint'

(...)
(...)
(...)

[14:09:08] Finished 'package' after 4.3 s

➜  ls -lah chrome_app_release.zip
-rwxr-xr-x 1 pulsar Kein 5,5M 16. Dez 15:24 chrome_app_release.zip
```

Errors in *hint Tasks are intentional and meant to be addressed by the developer.

### Available Gulp Tasks:

* validate_css
* validate_js
* validate_html
* package

Any of this tasks can be run autonomously via gulp command line, example:

```
➜  gulp package
```
